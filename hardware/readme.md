# The hardware for the pedal.

- The [main pcb](https://github.com/JordanAceto/whooshy_sound/tree/main/hardware/main_pcb) is the heart of the project.

- Once the pedal is built, you need at least one [VCF plug-in board](https://github.com/JordanAceto/VCF_plug_in_boards/tree/0e87489fe4cad95ea398019b08850a9033277694) to complete the project.

- Various filter plug-in boards can be swapped in and out to experiment with sounds.

- The [front panel](https://github.com/JordanAceto/whooshy_sound/tree/main/hardware/front_panel) and [jack panel](https://github.com/JordanAceto/whooshy_sound/tree/main/hardware/jack_panel) are simple pcb panels as a cheap way to get an ok looking finished project.

- To build the pedal, you'll need flying wires from the main pcb to the 1/4" jacks, 9 volt DC power entry, and bypass footswitch. A wiring diagram for this is in the [offboard wiring](https://github.com/JordanAceto/whooshy_sound/tree/main/hardware/offboard_wiring) directory.

- [Drill guides](https://github.com/JordanAceto/whooshy_sound/tree/main/hardware/drill_guides) may help when drilling out the Hammond 1590BBS enclosure.

- Note that with a plug-in board installed the circuitboards are just a _liiiiitle_ bit too tall to fit into a Hammond 1590BB. Make sure to get an enclosure that is deep enough, like a 1590BB**S**.
