# Files for low cost [JLCPCB smt assembly](https://jlcpcb.com/smt-assembly)

## Note that not all smt components are included! A few small parts will need to be hand soldered.

### Missing parts include:
- STM32L031F4
- MCP4821
- LT3467A
- PMEG2010 diodes
- DC-DC converter inductor
- DC-DC convererter feedback resistors
- LM4040
- LT1117

The above parts were not in stock at the time of order.

If you are using the JLCPCB assembly service in the future, check on those parts and see if they are back in stock. Also be sure to check that other parts have not gone out of stock.

The assembly saves hand soldering almost 90 parts for about ~$4.50 per board (which included the cost of the parts). Whether this is worth it or not is up to you.
