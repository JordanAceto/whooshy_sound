# Effects pedal for making whooshy sounds

### This pedal accommodates various VCF plug-in boards, and contains rich modulation features.

### This is just the start of a work in progress

Next steps: 
- make sure that the envelope follower goes right-way-round, meaning- in "normal" mode it should sweep up, and in "inverted" mode it should sweep down.
- do some more tests of the envelope follower, these are tricky to make "feel good".
- write code/evaluate the STM32L0 LFO.
- evaluate the +/-12 volt DC-DC converter.
