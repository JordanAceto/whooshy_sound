### [SCHEMATIC](https://github.com/JordanAceto/whooshy_sound/blob/main/hardware/main_pcb/construction_docs/whooshy_sound_main_pcb_schematic.pdf)

### Features:
- Guitar pedal style stomp box.
- Can accept a wide variety of [filter plug-in boards](https://github.com/JordanAceto/VCF_plug_in_boards).
    - For guitars and other instrument-level signals I recommend starting with the "2164" filter plug-in boards, because these have very low noise and CV feedthrough.
    - Other plug-in boards will work for guitars, but may be a little noisier and thumpier than you wish. Try them out, they vary.
    - If you're using this in an effects loop or after a preamp, it doesn't matter as much and any of them will probably be fine.
- Manual frequency and resonance controls.
- Digitally generated LFO with morphing waveshaper, smoothly crossfades from triangle to sine to square to sample & hold.
- Analog envelope follower for when you want to quack and bwow instead of whoosh.
